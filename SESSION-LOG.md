# Session 67 — Blog Pipeline Live + kre8r-land Crash Audit (2026-04-30)

## Goal
Get first blog post live at 7kinhomestead.land/blog. Fix kre8r-land crash loop (3500 restarts).
Fix blog JSON truncation. Debug and resolve the "Not authenticated" publish chain.

## What Was Built / Fixed

### Blog Pipeline — End-to-End Live
- **Root bug**: production server.js global auth guard was intercepting `POST /api/blog/posts`
  before blog.js's `requireAuth` (which accepts the internal key) ever ran. Only `GET` was
  whitelisted. Fix: added `POST /api/blog/posts` to server.js whitelist.
- **Push-to-live proxy** (`src/routes/blog.js`): local server proxies publish to kre8r.app
  using `INTERNAL_API_KEY`. No session needed. Same pattern as AffiliateΩr sync.
- **Blog JSON truncation fix** (`src/routes/mailor.js`): replaced JSON response format with
  plain-text `TITLE: xxx\n---\nHTML body` delimiter format. Claude no longer tries to JSON-encode
  long HTML bodies. `callClaudeRaw()` + `parseBlogResponse()` added.
- **parseBlogResponse hardened**: strips markdown code fences, extracts `<body>` from full HTML
  documents, handles `# heading` and `**bold**` in title line, has fallback for missing delimiter.
- **Blog system prompt tightened**: explicit rules — no meta-commentary, no full HTML documents,
  no code fences, skip missing URLs rather than fabricate them, strict TITLE:/--- format.
- **Publish button UX**: after success, button replaces itself with
  `✓ Published · View Post →` link to `7kinhomestead.land/blog/{slug}`.
- **First post live**: "Nobody Told Me This — And It Would Have Changed Everything"
  published at 7kinhomestead.land/blog. YouTube thumbnail, TOC, Rock Rich CTA working.

### kre8r-land Crash Audit (Opus background agent)
All 8 issues found and fixed, deployed:
1. **CRITICAL** `stateFull` ReferenceError (`sources.js`) — Temporal Dead Zone bug. Variable
   used on line 348 before declared on line 354. Threw on every OLH aggregator run.
   Primary cause of the 3500-restart crash loop. Fix: moved declaration above usage.
2. **HIGH** No `unhandledRejection` / `uncaughtException` handlers — any unhandled async
   error killed the process in Node 18+. Added both handlers to server.js.
3. **HIGH** `migrateOlhUrls()` bare call at module load — if DB not ready, crashed
   `require('./src/cron')` and server never started. Wrapped in try/catch.
4. **MEDIUM** SIGTERM handler could stall — `server.close()` callback never fired if
   `closeAllConnections` unavailable. Added 10s force-exit fallback (`gracefulShutdown()`).
5. **FRONTEND** `openPP()` crashed on `price/acres = 0 or null` — `Math.round(Infinity)`
   and `NaN.toLocaleString()` failures. Guarded all values with `|| 0` fallbacks.
6. **FRONTEND** `l.score` undefined — `ppScoreNum` rendered "undefined". Fixed with `score = l.score || 0`.
7. **BACKEND** `GET /:id` missing try/catch in listings.js — unstructured 500 on DB error.
8. **FRONTEND** `l.loc.split(',')` TypeError — guarded with `(l.loc || '').split(',')`.
9. **PM2** Added `listen_timeout: 10000` to ecosystem.config.js (OLH migration on boot).

# Session 65 — AffiliateΩr Two-Way Sync + Opus 4.7 Audit + OLH URL Fix (2026-04-29)

## Goal
Wire Electron → production gear sync (Push/Pull), run Opus 4.7 architecture audit and close
all 5 punch list items, fix OLH listings going to 404 pages, stabilize multi-user DB topology.

## What Was Built / Fixed

### AffiliateΩr — Two-Way Sync (`kre8r`)
- `src/routes/affiliator.js`:
  - `POST /push-to-live`: local endpoint reads ALL `affiliate_links` from AppData DB, POSTs
    to production with `INTERNAL_API_KEY`. Sends all items (not just show_on_gear=1) so
    hidden/inactive state propagates correctly.
  - `POST /sync-from-electron`: production endpoint, `X-Internal-Key` auth. Full upsert —
    new rows INSERT, existing rows UPDATE with last-write-wins on `updated_at`.
  - `GET /gear-export`: production endpoint, returns all `affiliate_links` for pull sync.
  - `POST /pull-from-live`: local endpoint fetches gear-export from production, upserts into
    local DB. Allows Jason to pull Cari's kre8r.app edits before working.
  - `applySyncBatch()` helper: shared upsert logic for both sync endpoints. Handles INSERT
    for new rows, last-write-wins UPDATE for existing rows, skips UNIQUE collisions.
  - All manual edit paths now stamp `updated_at=datetime('now')`.
- `src/db.js`:
  - Added `updated_at DATETIME` column to `affiliate_links` via safe ALTER TABLE migration.
  - Added explicit pragma check for `updated_at` after batch migration (older SQLite compat).
  - Added `transaction: (fn) => _activeDb().transaction(fn)` to module.exports — routes were
    getting "db.transaction is not a function" because proxy never exposed it.
- `server.js`: auth whitelist entries for `/sync-from-electron`, `/gear-export`.
- `public/affiliator.html`:
  - Added 📥 Pull from Live button alongside 📤 Push to Live.
  - `pullFromLive()` function — shows "X added, Y updated" or "already in sync".
  - Push feedback now shows inserted + updated counts separately.

### DB Topology Investigation
- Confirmed: `.bat` launcher uses `AppData\Roaming\kre8r\kre8r.db` (12MB, active).
- `database/kre8r.db` in project folder was stale (4.8MB, April 23) — deleted.
- `kre8r-electron-backup.db` was git-tracked — untracked, added to `.gitignore`.
- `db.js` now logs loud warning when `DB_PATH` is unset.

### Opus 4.7 Architecture Audit (Sessions 32–65)
Full senior review of DB topology, multi-user sync, AffiliateΩr, and post-V2 additions.
All 5 punch list items closed:
1. ✅ Production DB backup — daily 3am cron, 14-day rolling (`/home/kre8r/backups/`)
2. ✅ `updated_at` + last-write-wins sync — prevents silent overwrites between Jason/Cari
3. ✅ INSERT/DELETE gap fixed — `applySyncBatch()` upsert + soft-delete via `active=0`
4. ✅ Stale DB deleted, backup untracked from git, `DB_PATH` warning added to `db.js`
5. ✅ Cari access model decision — parked (Electron setup when she's home), added to TODO

### OLH URL Format Fix (`kre8r-land`)
- Root cause: OLH feed has no URL field. Old construction was `{titleSlug}-{tract}` — wrong.
  Correct format verified against live site: `properties/{state}-land-for-sale/{titleSlug}`.
- `src/aggregator/sources.js`: fixed URL construction for all future OLH ingests.
- `src/aggregator/index.js`: one-time migration `migrateOlhUrls()` runs on startup.
  - Row-by-row with individual try/catch (UNIQUE collision fallback appends tract number).
  - Sentinel: skips if any OLH URL already contains `-land-for-sale/`.
  - Result: **134 OLH URLs fixed**, 551 skipped (no state/title data).
- Fixed port 3010 crash loop on kre8r-land server (PM2 auto-restart hitting EADDRINUSE).
- Fixed git object permissions (`chown -R landapp:landapp .git` after root pull).

## DB Notes
- Production DB backup cron installed: `sudo -u kre8r crontab -l` on kre8r.app droplet.
- `INTERNAL_API_KEY` confirmed set in kre8r.app `.env` and local `.env`.
- kre8r-land DB: `land.db` on `7kinhomestead` droplet at `/home/landapp/kre8r-land/database/`.

## Commits

# Session 63 — AffiliateΩr Gear Page + VaultΩr Dedup + db.prepare Fix (2026-04-26)

## Goal
Recover interrupted session (power outage mid-affiliator edit), finish gear page on
kre8r-land, add OG image scraping + manual upload to AffiliateΩr, fix partner add broken,
clean VaultΩr 35k phantom records, confirm vault loop fix live.

## What Was Built / Fixed

### AffiliateΩr — Gear Page Images (`kre8r`)
- `src/routes/affiliator.js`:
  - Added `multer` image upload to `public/uploads/affiliate/` → `POST /links/:id/image`
  - Added `scrapeOgImage()` → background OG scrape on link create + `POST /links/:id/rescrape`
  - `GET /gear-public`: now includes `og_image_url`; makes local upload paths absolute URLs
  - `POST /links`: changed from `RETURNING id` + `.get()` → `.run()` + `lastInsertRowid`
    (RETURNING id not reliable across better-sqlite3 versions — this was breaking partner add
    and links loading)
- `src/db.js`:
  - Added `og_image_url TEXT` column to `affiliate_links` via safe ALTER TABLE migration
  - Added `purgeArchivedFootage()` — hard-deletes all `quality_flag = 'archived'` records
  - Added `countFootage()` — paginated count for vault pagination bar
  - **Root fix**: added `prepare: (sql) => _activeDb().prepare(sql)` to `module.exports` —
    affiliator.js called `db.prepare()` directly but it was never exported; every single
    affiliator API call was silently 500-ing; partners tab showed empty, add partner did nothing
- `public/affiliator.html`:
  - Product image section in link modal: preview thumbnail, 📷 Upload Image, 🔄 Re-fetch from URL
  - `_activeLinkId` state tracks open link for post-save image upload
  - `setImgPreview()`, `uploadLinkImage()`, `rescrapeOg()` functions

### gear.html — kre8r-land (`kre8r-land`)
- Replaced hardcoded `GEAR` array with `GEAR_FALLBACK` + live fetch from `kre8r.app/api/affiliator/gear-public`
- `normalizeItem()` maps API shape to card fields
- `renderGear(items)` function — works with both live data and fallback
- Deployed to 7kinhomestead.land/gear — confirmed live ✅

### VaultΩr Cleanup (`kre8r`)
- `src/routes/vault.js`: added `POST /dedupe` and `POST /purge-archived` routes
- `public/vault.html`: Dedupe + Purge Dupes + Reset Scan buttons in scan-done banner
- Ran dedupe + purge — cleaned 35k phantom records (root cause: `runIngest` never cleared
  `to_ingest` array in prior session, same 3,853 files ingested ~9 times)

### VaultΩr Loop Fix — Confirmed Live (Session 62b fixes)
- `footageFilePathExists` now checks both `file_path` and `proxy_path` — proxy re-ingest loop eliminated
- `processProxyUpdate` propagates `project_id` to BRAW record — project assignment no longer silently dropped
- Vault confirmed stable: drop proxy → ingests once ✅

## Commits Needed
- kre8r: db.prepare export fix + og_image_url migration + purgeArchivedFootage + vault routes + affiliator image endpoints
- kre8r-land: gear.html live fetch (already committed `323262d`)

# Session 62b — VaultΩr Proxy Re-ingestion Loop + Project Assignment Fix (2026-04-26) AffiliateΩr + Three-App Auth Layer + VectΩr Auto-Run (2026-04-25)

## Goal
Build AffiliateΩr in Kre8r, wire session-based auth into KinOS and OrgΩr, implement
VectΩr Sunday auto-run cron, and architect the cross-app deployment strategy.

## What Was Built

### AffiliateΩr (`kre8r`)
- `src/db.js`: 3 new tables — `affiliate_partners`, `affiliate_links`, `affiliate_clicks`
- Pre-seeded 12 known partners (Amazon active, 11 pending with signup URLs)
- `src/routes/affiliator.js`: full CRUD for partners + links, analytics, tracked URL builder
- `server.js`: `/r/:partnerKey/:linkKey` public redirect endpoint (whitelisted from auth),
  click logging with optional `?vid=PROJECT_ID` video attribution, `/api/affiliator` mount
- `public/affiliator.html`: 4-tab UI — Partners (signup checklist), Tracked Links,
  Analytics (clicks/estimated commission/30-day chart), Link Generator
- `public/js/nav.js`: AffiliateΩr added to Dist dropdown

### KinOS Auth Layer (`kinos`)
- `bcrypt` + `express-session` installed
- `src/db.js`: `password_hash`, `remember_token` columns added to `family_members`;
  `express_sessions` table added
- `server.js`: inline SQLiteStore, session middleware, auth middleware (X-Member-Id
  injection from session — zero changes to 9 route files), login/logout/me/set-password
  routes, `KINOS_ADMIN_PW` first-run seed for parent accounts, `KINOS_INTERNAL_TOKEN` cron bypass
- `public/login.html`: avatar picker — 8 family member cards, click yours, enter password
- `public/manage-passwords.html`: admin sees all 8 members, sets any password; status badge
  flips live; Karen's card shows ♾ grandparent pill
- Karen (id=8, `grandparent_mode:true`): 10-year cookie on login — never logs in again
- Open-access fallback when no passwords configured (dev mode preserved)

### OrgΩr Auth Layer (`orgboard`)
- `bcrypt` + `express-session` installed; `.gitignore` created (first git repo init)
- `src/db.js`: `users` table + `express_sessions` table added
- `server.js`: same SQLiteStore pattern; auth middleware; full user CRUD API
  (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/users`, `/api/auth/set-password`,
  `/api/auth/status`); `ORGR_ADMIN_PW` seeds jason admin; duplicate `db` require removed
- `public/login.html`: clean username/password form
- `public/manage-users.html`: admin UI — add users, change passwords, delete users,
  role badges (admin/user), card turns green on save

### VectΩr Auto-Run (`kre8r`)
- `src/routes/vectr.js`: new `POST /api/vectr/weekly-auto` — runs full sync + calls
  Claude (non-streaming via `callClaudeMessages`) to generate strategic pre-read;
  stores result in `kv_store` as `vectr_auto_draft`; new `GET/DELETE /api/vectr/auto-draft`
- `server.js`: `scheduleVectrAutoRun()` — Sunday 14:00 UTC (10am ET) cron, fires
  `weekly-auto` endpoint, logs result
- `public/northr.html`: amber banner appears when auto-draft is waiting;
  `openVectrWithDraft()` opens VectΩr panel with pre-read injected as first assistant message;
  `checkVectrAutoDraft()` called on DOMContentLoaded

## Deployment Notes
**Three-app architecture decision:**
- Kre8r → stays on its own DO droplet (video processing, heavy workloads)
- KinOS + OrgΩr → shared $12/mo DO droplet (both are lightweight Express + SQLite)
- kinos.life already live; OrgΩr needs domain assignment
- Inter-app calls between KinOS + OrgΩr: localhost on shared droplet (reliable)
- Kre8r ↔ KinOS/OrgΩr: HTTPS with internal API key (established pattern)

**To activate auth on live servers:**
- KinOS: set `KINOS_ADMIN_PW` + `SESSION_SECRET` in .env, restart → seed fires automatically;
  log in as Jason → go to `/manage-passwords` → set all family member passwords;
  set Karen's last — she logs in once, never again (10-year cookie)
- OrgΩr: set `ORGR_ADMIN_PW` + `SESSION_SECRET` in .env, restart → jason seeded;
  go to `/manage-users` → add any additional users

## Pending (Next Sessions)
- Deploy KinOS + OrgΩr to shared DigitalOcean droplet
- Activate KinOS auth: set `KINOS_ADMIN_PW` + `SESSION_SECRET`, set passwords when Cari home
- Kre8r publish schedule → KinOS family calendar bridge (Tier 1 remaining)
- Rock Rich format profile in WritΩr (Tier 2)
- Update kre8r-land tool pages with tracked `/r/` affiliate URLs

# Session 62 — Dale Morning Brief + Affiliate→TreasΩr Bridge (2026-04-25)

## Goal
Build Dale morning CSW generator (OrgΩr Tier 1) and the AffiliateΩr → OrgΩr TreasΩr
commission bridge (Tier 1 cross-app bridge).

## What Was Built

### Dale Morning CSW Generator (`orgboard`)
- `src/routes/csw.js`: `POST /api/csw/morning-generate` — finds exec AIE per org (via
  `exec_aie_job_id` or falls back to top-level job with a persona), pulls org state:
  all stats + conditions, stale open orders >24h, TreasΩr bucket balances, active
  battle plans, strategic brief from Kre8r snapshot; builds full morning brief prompt
  as Dale persona; calls Claude to produce 2-3 CSWs as a JSON array; inserts all as
  `trigger_type: 'morning_brief'` status `pending`; idempotent — skips if already ran today
- `server.js`: daily 7am `setInterval` cron fires `morning-generate` with internal token;
  logs CSW count to console on completion
- **Live test**: generated 2 real CSWs on first run — situations referenced actual Kre8r
  pipeline data (content stalled 10+ days, email list 26 days cold, $0 TreasΩr)

### AffiliateΩr → OrgΩr TreasΩr Commission Bridge (`kre8r`)
- `src/db.js`: new `affiliate_commissions` table — tracks confirmed earnings with
  `orgr_synced` flag and `orgr_income_id` for reconciliation
- `src/routes/affiliator.js`:
  - `GET /api/affiliator/commissions` — list history with partner names
  - `POST /api/affiliator/commissions` — logs commission locally, then bridges to OrgΩr
    `POST /api/treasor/income/:orgId` (fire-and-store pattern)
- `.env`: added `ORGR_URL`, `ORGR_DEFAULT_ORG_ID`, `ORGR_INTERNAL_TOKEN` commented stubs
  (activate when OrgΩr is deployed and accessible from Kre8r)

## Activation Notes
- `ORGR_URL=http://localhost:3002` (local) or `https://orgr.yourdomain.com` (deployed)
- `ORGR_DEFAULT_ORG_ID=4` (7 Kin org id in OrgΩr)
- Commission bridge is dormant until both env vars are set — fails silently, logs locally

## Commits
- orgboard: `9ebcdc6 Add Dale morning brief generator — daily 7am CSW cron`
- kre8r: `69aafaf Add AffiliateΩr commission logging + OrgΩr TreasΩr bridge`

# Session 62b — VaultΩr Proxy Re-ingestion Loop + Project Assignment Fix (2026-04-26)

## Goal
Diagnose VaultΩr acting "dumb" — same clip ingesting repeatedly + footage not showing
in EditΩr even after project assignment.

## Root Causes Found

### Bug 1 — Proxy re-ingestion loop (`src/db.js`)
`footageFilePathExists(filePath)` only checked `file_path` column. Proxy files processed
via `processProxyUpdate` never get their own `file_path` record — only the BRAW record's
`proxy_path` column gets updated. So every server restart or chokidar re-trigger returned
"not ingested" for the proxy file, causing the full proxy pipeline to re-run endlessly.

**Fix**: `footageFilePathExists` now checks both `file_path` and `proxy_path`.

### Bug 2 — Project context not propagated through proxy update (`src/vault/intake.js`)
`processProxyUpdate` updated classification, thumbnails, codec, duration etc. but never
wrote `project_id` to the BRAW record. If BRAW was ingested before project context was
known (flat intake folder, no `[id]_slug` subfolder), and the proxy arrived via the
watcher with a projectId, the project assignment was silently dropped.

**Fix**: `processProxyUpdate` now writes `project_id` to the BRAW record if the BRAW
had none and the caller passed one.

## Intake Workflow Clarification (for old projects)
Projects created before the `[id]_slug` folder convention don't get auto-assigned by
the watcher. Two recovery paths:
1. Use VaultΩr bulk-assign after ingest (select clips → "Assign to Project")
2. Name the intake subfolder `[project_id]_anything` and watcher auto-assigns going forward

## Commits
- kre8r: fixes in `src/db.js` (footageFilePathExists proxy_path check) + `src/vault/intake.js` (project_id propagation) — confirmed live Session 63

# Session 60 — BattlePlanΩr Print Polish + Receipt Scanner Bridge (2026-04-24)

## Goal
Polish BattlePlanΩr print output (3 nitpicks from PDF review), build KinΩS receipt scanner
bridge into TreasΩr, and fix the receipt scanner itself which Cari reported as never working.

## What Was Built

### BattlePlanΩr Print Fixes (`orgboard/public/battleplan.html`)
- **Header**: Removed `· PLAN` type suffix; "BATTLE PLAN" now renders in red bold only
- **Legend cards**: Added `height:100%` to `.legend .l` — all 4 tier cards now equal height
- **Page breaks (from prior session)**: Already confirmed working perfectly by user

### TreasΩr ↔ KinΩS Receipt Scanner Bridge
**Backend** (`orgboard/src/routes/treasor.js`):
- New `POST /api/treasor/scan-receipt` endpoint — proxies base64 image to KinΩS at
  `http://localhost:3001/api/ai/scan-receipt`, returns parsed receipt JSON
- Server-side proxy means it works even when TreasΩr is accessed remotely

**Frontend** (`orgboard/public/treasor.html`):
- "📷 Scan Receipt" button added to Entry tab (teal, alongside Log Income / Log Expense / PO)
- Hidden `<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">` for camera/upload
- Canvas resize: 1600px max, 0.90 quality (same as KinΩS) before sending to backend
- Review modal: shows store name, date, all line items, total; pre-fills description/vendor/date/amount
- Bucket selector (auto-populated with org's configured buckets)
- Logs as single expense via existing `POST /api/treasor/expenses/:orgId` → updates balances live

### KinΩS Receipt Scanner Bug Fix (`kinos/src/routes/ai.js`)
**Root cause**: `max_tokens: 1500` was too low — a real grocery receipt with 20+ items
generates 2000–3000 tokens of JSON. Claude's response was being truncated mid-JSON,
causing `JSON.parse` to throw and returning a generic error to Cari.
- Bumped `max_tokens` from 1500 → 4096 for `scan-receipt` route
- Added explicit try/catch around `JSON.parse` with clear, actionable error message
- Requires `pm2 restart kinos` to go live

## Commits
- kinos: `Fix receipt scanner — bump max_tokens 1500→4096, add parse error handling`
- orgboard: not a git repo

# Session 59 — 7KH Homepage v11 + Water PDF + Member Count API (2026-04-24)

## Goal
Complete the Kajabi 7kinhomestead.com homepage v11: hover-expand tool preview video strip,
community section video replacement. Fix water calculator PDF. Build live member count API.

## What Was Built

### Water Calculator PDF Report (`kre8r-land/public/water.html`)
- Fixed broken `@media print` CSS (was accidentally nested inside `@media(max-width:480px)`)
- Replaced with solar-tool-style `window.open('','_blank')` isolated white HTML report
- Blue `#3b82f6` CTA button, 4 metric cards, spec table, water law box, BOM tables (Good/Better/Best)
- Affiliate links in BOM. Auto-prints on load via `window.onload=()=>window.print()`

### 7kinhomestead.land Homepage Video Banners (`kre8r-land/public/index.html`)
- Wistia autoplay/muted/loop video banners added above each of 5 tool cards
- IDs: Land=ppyykneltj, Lifestyle=311y3wvfph, Freedom=ao65emty5y, Solar=3uiwl9626y, Water=fhyf4qzggj

### Kajabi Homepage v11 (`7kin-homepage_v11.html` — full page custom code block)
**Tool Preview Strip** (below existing v10 Tool Shed block):
- 5 Wistia video tiles in a single row, hover → scale(2.35) forward over siblings
- Siblings dim to opacity:.22 + brightness(.45) while one is hovered
- CSS `:has()` expands strip padding-bottom from 64px → 420px on hover (no JS needed)
- Edge tiles: `transform-origin:top left` (first) / `top right` (last) — prevents off-screen bleed
- Middle tiles: `transform-origin:top center`
- Full-width Kajabi breakout: `width:100vw; left:50%; margin-left:-50vw`
- Tool description fades in on hover. Mobile: horizontal scroll, tap to expand.
- No "Open Tool" button — build value, require community join

**Community Section Video** (replaces base64 Jason photo):
- Wistia `aaairbit16` replaces `<div class="community-img">` base64 JPEG
- Hover: `scale(1.04)` + red glow (subtle — card is already full-size)
- Desktop hover → play, mouseleave → pause. Mobile tap toggles.
- Member badge overlay: `500+` count (red Bebas Neue), "People who 'get it'", subtext

### `/api/member-count` Endpoint (`kre8r-land/src/routes/member-count.js`)
- Public CORS-open endpoint at `https://7kinhomestead.land/api/member-count`
- Kajabi OAuth2 client_credentials token (same pattern as kre8r main AudiencΩr)
- Fetches contacts, caches result 1 hour in-memory
- `MEMBER_COUNT_OVERRIDE` env var: when set, skips Kajabi call (currently set to 500)
- Fallback chain: live → stale cache → hardcoded 500 (never breaks the badge)
- v11 community badge JS fetches this endpoint on load and updates `#community-count`
- Deployed to 7kinhomestead.land, live and tested

### 7 Kin Trusted Partners (TODO added)
- BillyLand, LandLimited, OnlineLandHub confirmed as trusted partners
- OnlineLandHub: RSS feed + referral commission agreement in place
- Full infrastructure spec added to TODO.md (partners table, affiliate param injection, badge display)

## Commits
- kre8r-land: `Add /api/member-count - live Kajabi count with 1h cache`
- kre8r-land: `Add MEMBER_COUNT_OVERRIDE env var`
- kre8r-land: `Homepage: add Wistia autoplay video banners to all 5 tool cards`
- kre8r-land: `Water tool: replace @media print with solar-style window.open PDF report`
- kre8r (main): TODO.md updated (Trusted Partners spec added)
- Kajabi v11: local file only — paste into Kajabi custom code block to deploy

# Session 58 — OIC + Dale AIE + Nav Redesign (2026-04-22)

## Goal
Build the Organizational Information Center (OIC) — weekly stat graphs, VFP conditions, Dale's
full org context. Fix Dale's stat blindspot. Redesign board.html nav to icon bar.

## What Was Built

### OIC — Organizational Information Center (`public/oic.html` + `src/routes/oic.js`)
Standalone page at `/oic`. Icon nav matching board.html aesthetic.
- **VFP Board**: every org/division/job VFP seeded into `vfp_conditions` table with condition badges
- **Stat cards**: 13-week line graphs (Chart.js), Y-axis auto-scales to data range (not zero-based),
  division-colored lines, current value prominent, delta % vs prior week, gap-aware (null = no line)
- **Condition badges**: clickable on every stat and VFP — picker sets Power/Affluence/Normal/Emergency/Danger/Non-Existence/Unassigned
- **+ Report button**: manual weekly snapshot entry per stat (date picker, value, note)
- **Responsible post**: assign which job owns each stat (shown on card)
- **⟳ Collect This Week**: manual trigger for weekly snapshot collection
- **⬡ Seed VFPs**: one-click seeds all org/division/job VFPs into condition board

### Weekly Snapshot Scheduler (`server.js`)
- `stat_weekly_snapshots` table: `UNIQUE(stat_id, week_start)` — one row per stat per Sunday
- Scheduler fires hourly; on Sunday 18:xx triggers collection for all orgs
- Startup missed-collection check: if Sunday has passed and no snapshots exist, collects immediately
- Collection pulls latest `stat_reports` value per stat and locks it as that week's Sunday snapshot
- 1-year retention (all rows kept); 13 weeks displayed in OIC graphs

### Dale's Context (fixed + expanded)
- **Stat blindspot fixed**: removed `kre8r_key IS NOT NULL` filter — Dale now sees ALL org stats
- Stats block now includes `condition` level and `owner` (responsible job title) per stat
- Employee chat route also fixed with same scope expansion

### Board.html Nav Redesign
- Full icon bar replacing text buttons: 34px icon buttons with CSS tooltip (::after, data-tip)
- Grouped by: View toggles | Intelligence (🔍 Analyze, 💬 Chat, 📊 OIC) | Admin (📦 Orders, 📬 CSW, 📋 Policy DB, 🎓 Qual, ⚖ Admin Scale) | System (🔗 Kre8r, ⎙ Export, ⚙ Org Settings)
- CSW badge wired to new `.n-badge` class
- Labels: POLICY DB, QUAL (renamed from POLICIES, QUALS)

### DB Migrations
- `ALTER TABLE stats ADD COLUMN condition TEXT DEFAULT 'unassigned'`
- `ALTER TABLE stats ADD COLUMN responsible_job_id INTEGER`
- New: `stat_weekly_snapshots (stat_id, org_id, week_start, value, note, source, UNIQUE(stat_id,week_start))`
- New: `vfp_conditions (org_id, source_type, source_id, title, responsible_job_id, condition, notes)`

### Action Library
- `orgboard.stat.report { stat_id, org_id, value, note, week_start }` — AIEs can report stats via CSW

## Smoke Test
- OIC endpoint: ✅ 7 divisions, 3 stats, 13-week slots populated
- VFP seed: ✅ 43 VFPs seeded for 7 Kin Homestead
- Weekly collect: ✅ fired on startup (missed-collection check), kre8r stat captured for Apr 19

# Session 57 — OrgΩr AIE (AI Employees) + CSW System (2026-04-22)

## Goal
Build AI Employees (AIEs) — real job cards with persona_name + personality fields — postable
to any job on the org board. Build a full Completed Staff Work (CSW) system following Hubbard
Admin Tech: AIEs generate CSWs on orders, humans respond Approve/Reject/CSWP/Dev-T, approved
CSWs execute deterministic actions (create policy, append log, create order, etc.).

## What Was Built

### AIE Job Fields (OrgΩr `src/db.js` + `src/routes/jobs.js`)
- `persona_name TEXT` + `personality TEXT` columns on `jobs` table (ALTER migrations)
- Jobs PUT endpoint updated to allow both fields
- AIE marker shows on job cards: ⬡ [name] badge, colored ASK button
- Job drawer: "Posted Employee Name" + Personality textarea
- Exec AIE: `exec_aie_job_id INTEGER` on `orgs` table — job with no division_id gets full org context

### CSW System (`src/routes/csw.js` + `src/routes/actions.js` — new files)
**`csws` table:** Full lifecycle — situation, analysis, options_considered, recommendation,
action_requested, action_type, action_payload, status (pending/approved/rejected/cswp/devt/failed),
response_note, devt_type, routed_to_job_id, timestamps.
**`job_log_entries` table:** Persistent memory per job — type, content, ref_csw_id.

**`actions.js` (action executor):** Deterministic switch dispatch on action_type:
- `orgboard.policy.create/update` — writes to job_policies table
- `orgboard.order.create` — inserts org_orders
- `orgboard.job_log.append` — appends to job_log_entries
- `orgboard.no_action` — acknowledged, no write
- `kre8r.project.update_stage` / `.flag_stalled` / `kre8r.ideas.update_status` — cross-app via fetch

**`csw.js` routes:** GET list (with joins), GET count (badge), GET /:id, POST (create),
POST /:id/approve (execute + log), /reject, /cswp, /devt.

### CSW Generator + Order Processor (`src/routes/claude-assist.js`)
- `buildAieContext(jobId)` — loads job, division, policies, stats (Exec AIE gets all-org stats),
  last 20 job log entries. Altitude: division_id null → Exec AIE → full org stats context.
- `POST /api/claude/csw/:jobId` — streams Claude to produce structured JSON CSW, self-checks
  for Dev-T, saves to csws table, auto-logs to job_log_entries.
- `POST /api/claude/order/:jobId` — creates org_orders (issued_to_aie=1), triggers CSW generator.
- ACTION_LIBRARY constant injected into system prompt — valid types + payload schemas.

### Employee Chat (`/api/claude/employee/:jobId`)
SSE chat endpoint with full persona context (division, policies, stats, personality, job log).
AIE notation in org analysis: `[AIE: name]` shown in analyze + chat job maps.

### Board UI (`public/board.html`)
- `📋 CSW <badge>` button in topbar, 30s badge polling via `pollCswBadge()`
- CSW slide-in panel: card per CSW with full situation/analysis/options/recommendation,
  action type + payload display, Approve/Reject/CSWP/Dev-T action bar
- Policy pre-fill: action_payload content editable inline before approval
- Job log section in job drawer (loads on edit open)
- ORDER button in emp-modal: converts input text to order → POST /api/claude/order/:jobId
- Exec AIE select in org settings

## Smoke Test Results
All 5 status paths verified end-to-end:
- devt (self-filed, not_needing_approval) ✅
- approved (action executed, job log auto-written) ✅
- rejected (note stored) ✅
- cswp (returned to sender with note) ✅
- failed (invalid action payload caught, badge excludes failed) ✅

# Session 56 — Media Kit Fixes + Kre8r↔OrgΩr Bridge (2026-04-22)

## Goal
Fix media kit visual issues (hero text clipping, portrait headshot swap, logo cell overflow).
Build a permanent live API bridge between Kre8r and OrgΩr so all Kre8r business metrics
report into the org board with customizable stat mappings per division.

## What Was Built

### Media Kit Fixes (`public/media-kit.html` + `public/media-kit-kajabi.html`)
- Hero text clipping: `html{overflow-x:hidden}`, font `clamp(48px,5vw,80px)`, grid `1.5fr 1fr`
- Portrait: swapped to `jason-headshot.png` (1250×2000 proper headshot), `object-position:center top`
- Logo cells: `.logo-cell img{width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:contain;display:block;}`

### Kre8r Stats Export Endpoint (`src/routes/stats-export.js` — new)
`GET /api/stats-export` — X-Internal-Key auth (INTERNAL_API_KEY env var), auth-whitelisted.
Exports: pipeline health, publishing stats (30d), vault counts, projects, ideas, viral clips,
copyright marks, active strategic brief, live MailerLite email metrics. All in try/catch.

### OrgΩr Kre8r Bridge (`C:\Users\18054\orgboard\src\routes\kre8r-bridge.js` — new)
6 endpoints: POST /sync/:orgId, GET /snapshot/:orgId, GET /available/:orgId,
GET /mappings/:orgId, POST /map, DELETE /map/:statId.
DB: `kre8r_key TEXT` migration on stats table + new `kre8r_bridge_snapshots` table.
OrgΩr server.js + .env updated. Restarted with --update-env.

### OrgΩr Board UI (`public/board.html`)
- `🔗 KRE8R` button in topbar
- Slide-in panel: Available tab (all stat keys + MAP button) + Mapped tab (active mappings + unmap)
- Assign modal: pick division, label, unit → creates/updates stats row with kre8r_key
- Division header badges: live stat values render inline on division headers after sync
- `loadKre8rMappings()` called on every org load so badges are always fresh

# Session 55 — VectΩr + VaultΩr Tag Filter + SyncΩr Overwrite + v1.0.7 (2026-04-20)

## Goal
VectΩr weekly strategic session (full build A+B), VaultΩr tag chip client-side filtering,
SyncΩr overwrite import for teleprompter laptop, Electron installer v1.0.7.

## What Was Built

### VectΩr — Weekly Strategic Session (NorthΩr slide-out panel)
**Backend (`src/routes/vectr.js`):** 7 endpoints — sync, SSE chat (full context + pushback
mechanic), session persist (kv_store), brief lock/history, active brief getter.
`strategic_briefs` table + 8 db functions. Active brief injected into Id8Ωr + WritΩr prompts.

**Frontend (northr.html):** Amber ⬡ button, 460px slide-out panel, live sync progress,
SSE chat stream, ⬡ Lock Vector button → brief review modal.

Proven in use: Jason ran a full session, landed a strategic direction, fixed a script tied
to a 125k-view / 5k-like / 525-comment video. Creator quote: "this tool is amazing."

### VaultΩr Tag Chip Client-Side Filtering
Backend/DB/Vision/cloud already existed. Fix: 8 edits to vault.html — activeFilters.tag,
applyFilters() tag match, active pill, session persist, tag cloud highlight. Zero API calls.

### SyncΩr Overwrite Import
`replaceProjectFromSnapshot()` in db.js. `/import` accepts `overwrite:true`.
Amber checkbox in sync.html. Teleprompter laptop now gets clean project updates on pull.

### Electron v1.0.7
Built + deployed to kre8r.app/download. `npm run dist:win` → 238MB installer.
